# Big Ben Bonger

This is a PHONEGAP App.

Plays Westminster Chimes every quarter hour. User can select whether to hear the default
Big Ben chimes or Mantle Clock chimes.  User can also select which quarter-hour chimes
to ring.

I use it as a way to keep track of time while I'm programming.
Keeps me from getting engrossed at the computer -- then surprise, it's midnight.
It could be handy to somebody.

====== HOW THIS WORKS ======

IF LEFT IN FOREGROUND, the screen should never sleep and always display.
 
When exiting Big Ben Bonger with the phone's 'Back' button, this app will go into BACKGROUND MODE
and will continue to chime regardless of other activity on the phone.

To exit the Bonger completely, you must use the "X" in the top right corner of the app.
If the app is running in background mode, double-click on the Android Notification that says
there's a background app running. This will bring Big Ben back to foreground, so you
can exit the program. Likewise, you can always return Big Ben Bonger to foreground by clicking its
icon.
